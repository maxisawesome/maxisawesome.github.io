Title: Close Reading of All My Friends by LCD Soundsystem 
---

This is my favorite song of all time. There's a lot of things that make it a wonderful piece of art, but over the years the part I've grown to think is the crux of how it hits my soul is how well suited the music fits with the poetry. Obviously if I've listened to it umpteen times I'm gonna 

James Murphy, the lead singer and creative backbone of LCD Soundsystem.

It's a narrative track with murky references to a night out, or maybe [throwing a house part](https://genius.com/1389483) as this dude on genius.com seems to think, not that being right about this particular detail is important to overall feeling of the song. It's both *a* night and *to*night, and this contrast to builds up the main emotive backend of the song. Sure, this is one of many, but in the end we know that it's "many" is a finite number. We're committing the worst sin - missing something before it's even gone. It's about to be gone, dumbass, it's not time to miss it yet!

<span class="annotation" title="The opening line sets the scene for the in and our of 'tonight' vs 'all nights'. 'That's how it starts' kicks off the specific outing that this song refers to, but at the same time compares it to a standard formed by all the other nights and outings. There's also a sense that we're not too far from the middle of the distribution of 'nights.' This casual attitude and placement of the night kind of in the middle of all nights in terms of quality tugs against the palpable preciousness that the singer clearly has for the night. That interplay is what makes the poetry so potent, and over the course of the song as it builds to its sonic apex, the preciousness seeps into all those nights. The point it builds is that every moment with your friends is a treasure. This line sets the stage for all of that.">That's how it starts

We go back to your house </span>

<span class="annotation" title="I've generally imagined 'the charts' as the music charts, as James Murphy is the lead singer of the band. I don't think it's particularly important. It continues to build the sense of friendship. He's giving credit to the friend as they 'figure it out,' or at the least try to _do_ something. ">You check the charts 
And start to figure it out</span> </br>

<span class="annotation" title="Prepare for an adventure! This subsection builds the anticipation of the evening being a fun one. It also alludes to the experience all parts have together.  ">And if it's crowded, all the better </br>
Because we know we're gonna be up late </br>
But if you're worried about the weather </br>
Then you picked the wrong place to stay</span> </br>
<span class="annotation" title="This is the end of the first verse, framing us with the opening line, reminding us of the storyline of the single night.">That's how it starts</span> </br> </br>
<span class="annotation" title="We return to the lyrics after a music break, and we're rerooted into the framework from before.">And so it starts</span> </br>
<span class="annotation" title="The night progresses, the squad is together in the car, and you're heading out.">You switch the engine on</span> </br>
<span class="annotation" title="I only recently learned this is a Pink Floyd reference. The admission of age (which also come from referencing Pink Floyd) introduces a nostalgia. I'm about to be 27, and sometimes when I'm heading downtown with friends, we'll begin at a bar, get a few drinks at this place as a starter, move to another place for yknow, ambiance, then meander a bit more before making it to the main destination of the night. It's a little superfluous, and the impression I get from this line is that James and his friends are over that. They wanna go dancing, they don't need the pregame destinations, and just beeline there. We're dated well past the beginning, nearer to the end than the start, ">We set controls for the heart of the sun </br>
One of the ways we show our age</span> </br>

<span class="annotation" title="When we graduated college, my friends and all moved to different parts of the country. We had goals and careers to pursue. We just spent four years studying _for_ something. To go do whatever it was we wanted to leave our mark in. Moving to go pursue that, start our careers, move into the 'real world' was just the next move, right? We've spent this first five years planting those seeds, figuring out how to live on our own, support ourselves, and get with the plan.">You spent the first five years trying to get with the plan</span> </br>
<span class="annotation" title="We've all been terribly lonely doing it. Yeah yeah we have new friends in our new places, they're fine, but it's hard to beat shared experience. All we do is talk about silly plans to move to each others' cities, how we'll make a billion dollars and buy land for everyone to come live on, reminisce on stunts we pulled and memories we made. All this getting with the plan is fine and all, but underneath all that, any sort of 'dream' that resonates with me is some version of trying to be with my friends again.">And the next five years trying to be with your friends again</span> </br>
