## Writing:

If I find myself thinking about something for long enough, I'll attempt to wrangle all the different points of view in my head into a succinct essay. I do write them with a theoretic audience in mind, and communicating anything is fun, but like most burgeoning artists, that audience has thus far been isolated to family and friends only. Feel free to send me some feedback!

<!-- Please let me know what you think (contact info on about page)! I'd love feedback on my writing, especially if something is poorly communicated or if I got a fact wrong. Yyyyyoouuuu CAN write me if you disagree with some opinion but if you're not nice about it I'll ignore you, and "cold call complaints about a stranger on the internet's opinion" does not have a historic track record of sunshine and roses.  -->
