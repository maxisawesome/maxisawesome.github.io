summary: journalesque reflection on my time at cohere.for.ai, mostly written for future me

In October, I finished the [Cohere For AI Scholar's Program](https://txt.cohere.com/c4ai-scholars-program/) during which I published my first [paper](https://openreview.net/attachment?id=XUIYn3jo5T&name=pdf) (preprint version [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04564)). It was on data pruning - trying to measure and subsequently remove data from a language model's traning set while maintaining or improving performance. 

It was pretty inarguably the most potent 8 months of my life in terms of progress, learning, and self-understanding. A lot of the lessons I were quite tangible.

## How to do Science

### get started, start coding
I started off by digging through literature for about one week too long trying to find some magic metric that I could apply that would work on the first experiment. Obviously it did not exist already because if it did the very smart people at the For AI lab would not have sent me on the journey in the first place, but furthermore you'll gain plenty of ideas from actually doing the experiments.
### you do not need to have all the ideas
I was often feeling a lil anxious because 

### start writing early
Writing for myself takes long enough. Writing with a group of people in which you need to 

### communication IS science
At one point during 

### always be working towards a hypothesis, always be working towards a paper
You should be running experiments _for a reason_. Towards proving or disproving _an idea_. Otherwise you're just poking in the dark and you can do a lot better than [O(√n)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk#:~:text=This%20hints%20that,.).

<!-- In my paper, we retain the bottom, middle or top subset of our dataset based on the distribution of our pruning metrics. My first experiments had different cuts of the data, but they were just some effectively ideas on how to cut up the data. Top/Mid/Bottom was in pursuit of the idea that top is good, bottom is bad, and furthermore what the results  -->

### change one thing at a time
Do not introduce confounding changes. Do not do it. Resist the urge to jump thru five ideas in a single experiment ehehehe this'll save so much time - NO. If you change more than one thing will have no idea which of those things affected the results or if in fact the result is only so because of some combo of them man you'll have no idea. Do not do it.

### establish a baseline
you gotta measure against something. establish a baseline, or at the very least what the baseline will be, early on. Otherwise you have no idea what's happening lol this is actually science 101. 

### reduce cycle time (esp early experiments)


### remote work is bad mmkay
don’t be so hard on urself
