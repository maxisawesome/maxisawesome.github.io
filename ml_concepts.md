Title: Ways Machine Learning Shaped My World View

### A List of Machine Learning Concepts That Have Influenced My Way of Thinking 
#### Embedding vectors:
Many concepts fit well into an embedding space analogy. Music genres, let's say, are loosely defined categories that bleed in and out of each other through tractable and intractable connections. Representing them in high dimensional space and capturing a lot of these properties bodes well in the theory that _something_ like that is happening in our heads. Simply the idea that my mind is has representations of experiences has been influential to how I understand my own feelings and brain

#### local minima


<!-- #### high dimensional boundaries -->
#### train/test set difference
#### loss and reward
Loss is a measurement of failure that you want to minimize. In ML this is usually easy to measure, like number of incorrect predictions, but for 

#### skill and experience are synonymous
I was once watching Hikaru Nakamura, a top five supergrandmaster chess player, stream 3 minute vs 3 minute chess games. His opponent retreated his bishop and Nakamura recognized the position immediately. He played three or four positionally forcing moves entombing the bishop behind his opponent's pawns in the corner of the board. After the game he showed a classic match he had played _fourteen_ years before against a Mexican GM in which the same situation with the bishop happened. 
This framing is a very helpful playground for explanation. The skill part was the outcome, Hikaru winning the game. It's measurably, win or lose, and objective. How did we get there? In an arbitrary setting, it could be a neural network, a deep decision tree, a person, or a random choice of moves. This case it was Nak
Choosing the right moves was skilful, it was achieved through wisdom of knowing the path, which was originally found through intelligent thought. 

#### Bonus: shape rotators vs wordcels

The impetus of shape rotators vs wordcels makes itself super clear when you're familiar with any of the stuff above. Shapes are the high dimensional representations. Maniplating the maniforlds that relate the them in your brain and words are the abstract concepts constructed from them. Wordcels play on the levels of the abstractions and dont come down and deal with the technical underbelly, creating the dichotomy. Of course all people do both but the applicability of the analogy is amusing.
