Title: Dota 
---

From about 10 feet of perspective away from it, the Dota is one of the most confused communities on the internet. Playing Dota has given me more insight into human psychology than anything else in my life. I have committed to six thousand one hundred fifty three group projects with strangers of comletely unknown skill who hate me. 
To demonstrate the mismatch within Dota, you need to realize just how hard this game is. Let's start with a description of the game. Dota is a MOBA, meaning there is one map, you select one of about 115 heroes to play for one game of dota, you play on a team of five versus another team of five, you try to destroy the enemy's base before they destroy yours, there are "positions" akin to "point guard" or "post" in basketball, and each game is self-contained, not affecting your next "game of dota" - just like playing a new game of Settler's of Catan or a new game of basketball. 
Now that you are acquanted with the actual gamelplay, I'd like to fill you in on Dota's reputation. Dota is known in the gaming world for two things. One, being the highest skill cap, premier esport, and two, having _the most_ toxic community. Any proper netizen will realize the magnitude of the accolade "most toxic community in gaming" and shudder.
