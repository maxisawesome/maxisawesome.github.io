      <!-- Yes this is the default jekyll theme. No I will not be making a fancy custom one soon. It works well enough for now! I can't do everything I put on my todo list perfectly!

In more seriousness, I do plan to keep this blog running as a log of my journey into the tech world and specifically machine learning. Ideally it will be approachable yet informative to all readers: experienced practioners, total noobs who want to learn more, or even non-computer people. We'll see how I do with that.

I recently graduated from Occidental College with a double major in Math and Computer Science. I'm located in Austin, Texas, and am currently working for [KUNGFU.AI][kungfu]. -->
