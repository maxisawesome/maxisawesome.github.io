Title: About  
---
I'm Max. These days my main claim to fame is doing machine learning in industry in Austin. I've been working at [KUNGFU.AI](https://kungfu.ai) for most of the time it's existed. My work has touched domains like computer vision, natural language processing, unsupervised learning, audio, and reinforcement learning. Here's a list of some of the cooler stuff I've done. You can assume that my role on these projects fell somewhere under "make the neural network work":

* an algorithm to judge the price of collectables like Pokemon cards, baseball cards, or rare coins
* a computer vision project identifying and pricing exterior damage on cars from cell phone photos
* a model for processing ambient rainforest noise to find gunshots, chainsaws, and vehicles indicating poaching and logging
* a system to scan insurance corpora to extract helpful sentences that say things like "drug X is covered by plan Y under situation Z, but not situation A"
* a CTR (Click Through Rate) predictor for *crowd groaning noises* ads
* a FOD detector in runway radar scans
* A number of "information extractors" for large datastores of pdfs
* the algorithm that judges SXSW speaker applications alongside human judges
* and more! that are less interesting and slightly secret

I play ultimate frisbee on Riverside, enjoy backpacking where I can forget about the anthropocene, have spent a whopping \<REDACTED> hours playing Dota 2 (go EG), lift, and hang out in my backyard with [my cat](../cat).

I grew up here in Austin, my current locale, went to school in Los Angeles, then moved back home. 

You may find my poor attempts at profesionalism on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/max-marion/), my worst takes on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/maxisawesome538), or my straight up email behind my high tech captcha: m m a r i o n 5 3 8 @ < r o b o t s  g o  a w a y > @ g m a i l
