## A List of Opinions
In order to paint a better picture of myself, if that's something you're trying to ascertain. Reading on means you are by definition and I for one am honored. 

**Favorite Movies and TV shows:** I don't really watch movies or tv shows. Favorite anime is ZANKOKU NA TENSHI NO YOU NI

**Favorite Video Game:** The Witness, Portal 1 and 2, Dota, in approximately that order

**Favorite Puzzle Games:** The Witness, Portal, The Talos Principle, Baba is You, 

**Favorite Cloud:** Cumulus clouds tend to get all the flair, 

**Elon Musk:** The perennially controversial figure. I have nothing new to say, I'm annoyed more often than Musk lovers and less often than the Musk haters. I think he's more of a person than most leftists realize and he's pursing his interests. He's not _evil_ but billionaires would certainly contribute more to the general state of the people in a """"better system"""".

**Politics:** progressive. There is so much abundance in the world today, we could do a better job of sharing it. Lack of money should never prevent medical care, there are systems of power that have come to be that favor some over others, and . Trans rights are human rights, BLM, ACAB, etc. 

**Capitalism:** Late stage capitalism: not good! Capitalism overall: has done a really really good job of making life for human beings better and more fair. It's hard for me to envision a society I would want to live in that didn't involve capitalism. Perhaps more accurately stated: it's hard for me to envision a non-captialistic society that 

**Technology:** very good. I do stuff daily that my ancestors could not fathom. I have this whole shpeel on the monks that would sit in basements copying tomes night after night. Can you imagine trying to explain to them what a PDF is to them? Imagine trying to explain the significance of "ctrl+c, ctrl+vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv" on a copy of a holy books as it would compare to their life, or workhours. It's straight up magic when you think about it too hard. 
That being said, technology is aptly linked to fire in archaic element systems. Very powerful, very useful, all consuming, unruly, and unforgiving. The forest fire was unstoppable before the industrial revolution. Once we derive a technology, it's not able to be put away and removed from the literature. Forbidden knowledge has a historically poor track record. We should be weary.
